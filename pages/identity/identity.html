      <p><i><b>Click anywhere on the map to navigate to a different part of the library.</b></i></p>
      <p>This is the Bibliopelagia, a library of thoughts and experiences located somewhere within the depths of the ocean.</p>
      <p>Passing through the entranceway, you find yourself in the <b>Hall of Identity</b>, the central hub of the Bibliopelagia. Faint light filters down from above in the form of caustics rippling across the ceiling. The atmosphere is cold and heavy; though you feel submerged, you still feel, inexplicably, fully capable of drawing breath.</p>
      <p>Standing in front of you is an unmanned reception desk. Though the space behind the counter is empty, you get the faint sense that you're being observed, neither benevolently nor maliciously. To your left and right respectively are the doors to the <b>Hall of Sensation</b> and the <b>Hall of Imagination</b>, looming over you in dignified mahogany repose.</p>
