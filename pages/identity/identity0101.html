        <h1>THE SKELETON OF THE FOUNDER</h1>
        <p>Floating ethereally overhead among the rippling forms of the caustics is an enormous skeleton. Upon first glance it's easy to dismiss as nothing more than a regular whale, but a closer inspection reveals that dismissal to be slightly off the mark.</p>
        <p>Its anatomy is mammalian, to be sure, but its forms are ever so slightly twisted with an uncanny bent. Its proportions are familiar and its positioning unwieldy: despite the way its phalanges splay out into the shape of fins, its limbs are arranged in a configuration that would suggest the movement of a terrestrial creature paddling for dear life in the ocean. There is none of the grace of a true cetacean here.</p>
        <p>An involuntary shiver flows through your form at the sight, and you get an undeniable feeling of recognition. Its hindlimbs truncated and its cranium enlarged and elongated as they are, the skeleton is undeniably that of a human.</p>
