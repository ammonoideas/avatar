      <h1>LOST REALM</h1>
      <p>Here, everything becomes something else.</p>
      <p>The small and unassuming magnolia tree that curls over a bench becomes a picturesque glade in a fantasy forest where fascinating creatures emerge, and each of its silky petals is a treasure in and of itself.</p>
      <p>The gnarled roots of the larger tree are a treacherous but not unconquerable domain of adventure. The rusted fence that lines the old baseball diamond becomes spectacularly ancient in your eyes.</p>
      <p>The wooden bench that stands faithfully beside it, weathered planks splitting from one another and curling in on themselves, becomes a magnificent diving board.</p>
      <p>The concrete-floored notch cut into the school is a quiet reprieve from the elements and a space for storytelling.</p>
