      <h1>LOST REALM</h1>
      <p>Green unfurls out from beneath your feet and down, down a gentle hill. Along its perimeter emerges a wall of trees standing sentinel, their forms dark but not imposing.</p>
      <p>Their presence draws boundaries around the world you know, a gentle but firm reminder: “This is what there is. You are welcome to explore here. Everything beyond is for a later time.” The adult you who observes this place might find their presence claustrophobic, but you have long since slipped out of time.</p>
      <p>Now, that boundary feels comforting.</p>
