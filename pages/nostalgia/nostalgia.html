      <h1>THE HALL OF NOSTALGIA</h1>
      <p>The doors to the Hall of Nostalgia are heavier than any others you have tried thus far in your time at the Bibliopelagia. As you push them open, the atmosphere inside takes on a warm, comforting hue: a soft sepia tone unlike anything you've seen elsewhere in the library.</p>
      <p>Every book that lines these shelves is like an old friend.</p>
