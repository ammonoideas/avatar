      <p>There are lights streaking past outside. You’re sure of that fact, but you know you need not worry about their meaning nor even their presence.</p>
      <p>The sensations that surround you are muffled, and naught but your own sense of drowsiness reigns sovereign in this moment.</p>
      <p class="fade-in1">You can feel the fabric of the seat pressing into your check, the twisting of your body to lie against the seat, their quiet voices as they pore over directions in the driver’s and passenger’s seat — but all of it is far away.</p>
