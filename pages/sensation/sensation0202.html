      <p>There’s a comfort in knowing that this moment will end. In its own way, it relieves pressure.</p>
      <p>There is no great attachment to what you feel now, no expectation for what you must do. You needn’t even bear the responsibility of tending to your needs; no, you are at leisure to merely succumb to them, let your sleep lead you through the ebb and flow of consciousness rather than lead the sleep yourself, drag it alongside your body up stairs and into a bed.</p>
