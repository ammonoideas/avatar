      <h1>CANAL</h1>
      <p>The expanse of water sprawls before you like a sheet of black glass, white glimmers of artificial light rippling across its surface like a distorted mirror of the night sky above.</p>
      <p>All is still at this hour, and you dimly wonder about the origins of the water’s movement. None of the typical birds grace the canal’s surface, and there isn’t even the subtlest breeze across your face.</p>
